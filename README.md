This project entails building a user-friendly sandwich ordering application. It features a sandwich builder form that allows customers to input personal information, customize their sandwich, and place an order. The form incorporates a range of form controls, including textboxes for customer details, selection controls for delivery or pickup, and sandwich size, along with checkboxes and selection options for customizing the sandwich with various ingredients.
The program architecture is structured around three primary classes: Sandwich, Customer, and Order. The Sandwich class defines the attributes of a sandwich, the Customer class stores customer information, and the Order class manages order-related data and cost calculations. Importantly, these classes are designed independently of the graphical user interface (GUI), enhancing their reusability and versatility for potential future applications. Cost data for different selections, such as sandwich size and ingredients, is stored separately, promoting modularity and adaptability.
Upon order submission, customers are directed to an order confirmation form, which serves as a detailed receipt. This confirmation form displays the customer's particulars, the customized sandwich details, and the total cost of the order, all retrieved from the respective objects (Sandwich, Customer, Order).
